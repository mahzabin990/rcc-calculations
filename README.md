# rcc-calculations
Common and simple calculation tools daily used in RCC or Reinforced Concrete Design for engineers

In this repo I will add small and simple tools for solving academic common rcc problem sets.

Files added till now:

* [single-or-double.py](./single-or-double.py) : Based on some given inputs, this program can determine whether to approach a problem via singly reinforced beam or doubly reinforced beam.

I will add more tools later.
